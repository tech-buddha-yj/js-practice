        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that 
        conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized 
        as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, 
        JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
        The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
        to execute it. This course comprises 16 lessons on JavaScript programming. 
        Each lesson includes a combination of Wikipedia and Internet-based readings, YouTube videos,
        and hands-on learning activities. The entire course can be downloaded in book form by 
        selecting Download Learning Guide in the sidebar.
